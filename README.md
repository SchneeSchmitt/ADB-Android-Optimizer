# ADB-Android-Optimizer
Rootless (ADB) Android performance optimizer for every condition, from pure performance to power-saving

Those scripts can optimize Android from all methods and factors of the ADB possibility, such as disabling logging, accelerating CPU and GPU, applying rendering tweaks, network optimizations, memory settings, Dalvik virtual machine settings, and **even** optimizing the kernel settings. 

## Tweaks List
- `balanced`: Those are the main tweaks.
- `vulkan`: Privilege rendering using Vulkan. This works if your device supports Vulkan rendering.
- `qualcomm_only`: Tweaks for Qualcomm SoC devices **ONLY**.
- `compile`: If you don't need to use your phone for now. This one takes around 30 minutes to run. I recommend enabling "Keep screen on while charging" in developer options during the running process. Your device temperature will also increase during the running process.
- `extra_boost`: Gives a performance boost to your device but will halve its battery life.
- `power_saving`: Reduces performance but increases battery life.
- `hardware`: Makes your device become **MUCH FASTER AND WARMER**.

### Using them on Windows
Double-click the `command/runner.bat` file. You'll be asked what fix or mode to apply to your device as per the above list.

### Using them on Android (advanced)
Download both Shizuku and Shizushell on Google Play Store, start Shizuku, and type commands from the .bat files one by one with the header `adb shell` removed.
