## What type of optimization can those scripts do?
Those scripts can optimize Android from all methods and factors of the ADB possibility. Such as disabling logging, accelerating CPU and GPU, rendering tweaks, network optimizations, memory settings, Dalvik virtual machine settings, and **even** the kernel settings can also be optimized with those scripts. 

## Tweaks List üìë
- `balanced`: Those are the main tweaks.
- `vulkan`: Privilege rendering using Vulkan. This works if your device supports Vulkan rendering.
- `qualcomm_only`: Tweaks for Qualcomm SoC devices **ONLY**.
- `compile`: If you don't need to use your phone for now. This one takes around 30 minutes to run. I recommend enabling "Keep screen on while charging" in developer options during the running process. Your device temperature will also increase during the running process.
- `extra_boost`: Gives a performance boost to your device but will halve its battery life.
- `power_saving`: Reduces performance but increases battery life.
- `hardware`: Makes your device become **MUCH FASTER AND WARMER**.


## How To Use ‚ùì

### Windows Shell ‚äû
1. Make sure your devices/computers/emulators have ADB installed
2. Download all files from this repository by clicking on `Code`, and clicking `Download ZIP`
3. Enable Developer Options in the Settings app on the phone
4. Enable USB Debugging in the Developer Options
5. Connect your phone to the PC with a USB data cable
6. Open the `command` folder, and open the `bat` folder **ONLY** if you are using **Windows**, or the `sh` folder **ONLY** if you are using **macOS** or **Linux**
7. Run the `Balance` for the main tweaks
8. Run the `Vulkan` if your device supports Vulkan rendering. Most devices after 2020 should support Vulkan rendering
9. Run the `Qualcom_only` **ONLY** if you are using a Qualcomm SoC device
10. Run the `Compile` if you don't need to use your phone for now. This one takes around 30 minutes to run. I recommend enabling "Keep screen on while charging" in developer options during the running process. Your device temperature will also increase during the running process.
11. Run the `Extra_Boost` **OR** `Power_Saving` if you want better performance or battery life
12. **ONLY RUN** the `Hardware` if you want your device both **HOT AS FUCK** and fast as fuck
13. Restart the device

### Android (Advanced) ü§ñ
Download both Shizuku and Shizushell on Google Play Store, start Shizuku, and type commands from the .bat files one by one with the header "adb shell" removed
